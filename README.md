## Installation Instructions

### Node.js Installation

Make sure that you have Node.js installed on your computer by entering node -v in the command line. If successful, the command prompt will return a version number. If not, try reinstalling Node.js by following this link: https://nodejs.org/en/ and clicking on the LTS version. If you are on Windows, make sure to look for the section that says `Download for Windows (x64)`. If you are using macOS, make sure to look for the section that says `Download for MacOS (x64)`

### Clone the Code

Once Node.js is downloaded, click on the green code button and copy the link to this repository. Then open up your favorite code editor and open the terminal. In the terminal use `cd` to go to the root directory you want this repository to be cloned to. Finally, in the terminal, type `git clone <file link>` to clone this repository to your directory.

### Express.js Installation

You must also install the Express.js npm package to run the server. Since Express.js is an npm package instead of being built directly into node.js, you must type `npm init` into the command line to allow npm packages to be installed. Next, go to the server.js file, and in the command line, type `npm install express` to install Express.js on your computer. For documentation on Express.js follow this link https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html.
